# Duplicate-Finder-in-Nested-Lists

## Finding duplicates in nested lists and stopping at the first occurrence.

A set of nested lists were given and the objective was to verify the occurrence of duplicated integers, identify it and print it. 
If none was found, the goal was to print a (-1) next to the list.
